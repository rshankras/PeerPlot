## Collaborative Storytelling with Couchbase Lite P2P Sync

PeerPlot is a collaborative storytelling application that lets multiple users create stories together in real-time, even without constant internet connectivity. Users can add entries to an evolving narrative, suggest plot twists, and browse through story history - all while seamlessly syncing across devices.

## üöÄ Why This Matters for Developers

PeerPlot demonstrates how Couchbase Lite solves real-world collaboration challenges with:

- **Offline-first sync** for uninterrupted creativity (planes, remote areas, spotty Wi-Fi)
- **Zero-server architecture** using direct P2P communication
- **Automatic conflict resolution** for seamless merging of story contributions
- **Enterprise-ready security** with TLS encryption

> "What if your app worked as smoothly offline as it does online?"

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Couchbase Lite Superpower |
|---------|---------------------------|
| üìñ **Collaborative Writing** | Multi-device sync with Replicator |
| ‚ö° **Real-Time Updates** | LiveQuery for instant UI refresh |
| ‚úàÔ∏è **Offline-First** | Local database persistence |
| ü§ù **Conflict Resolution** | Custom merging algorithm |
| üîí **Secure Sync** | TLS encryption for P2P connections |
| üìö **Story History** | Query API for filtered data access |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Deep Dive

### Core Frameworks
- **SwiftUI**: For building the modern, responsive UI
- **Combine**: For reactive data handling and UI updates
- **Couchbase Lite**: For document storage and sync
- **Network.framework**: For peer-to-peer device discovery and connectivity

### Couchbase Lite in Action

```swift
// Simplified Sync Setup 
let app = AppService(
    database: database,
    conflictResolver: DefaultConflictResolver(),
    identity: identity,
    ca: ca
)

// Start P2P sync
app.start()
```

### App Architecture

#### Core Components
- **Views**: SwiftUI interfaces for story creation and browsing
  - `StoryView`: Main interface for collaborative writing
  - `StoryHistoryView`: Browse archived stories
  - `StoryHistoryDetailView`: View a specific archived story

- **Services**: Backend functionality
  - `DatabaseManager`: Manages Couchbase document storage
  - `AppService`: Handles peer-to-peer networking and sync

- **Data Flow**
1. User adds entry via the UI
2. Entry saved to local database by DatabaseManager
3. AppService detects change and syncs to nearby devices
4. Other devices receive update and update their UI

## üì• Getting Started

### Requirements
- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Couchbase Lite Framework (Enterprise Edition)

### Download Dependencies
1. Register and download Couchbase Lite Enterprise Edition from [Couchbase Downloads](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/)
2. Add the downloaded framework to the project's Frameworks directory

### Running the App
1. Clone the repository
2. Open PeerPlot.xcodeproj in Xcode
3. Build and run on a simulator or device

### Testing Peer-to-Peer Sync
For the best experience, run the app on two physical devices on the same network to see real-time synchronization in action.

## Demo App Limitations

This is a demonstration app showcasing Couchbase Lite's peer-to-peer synchronization capabilities. As such:

- Security is simplified for demo purposes
- The conflict resolution system is optimized for storytelling use cases
- Device discovery works best on local networks

## üîÆ Future Opportunities

How this demo could be extended with Couchbase Capella:

- Add AI-generated plot suggestions using vector search
- Enable cloud backup for archived stories
- Implement analytics for popular story trends
